Getting Help
Linux has three help options because they're for different situations. $man is the full, detailed user manual. $--help gives you a quick cheat sheet for a command. And $help is specifically for commands that are part of the shell itself, like $cd$.

You'd absolutely need $help for those built-in commands, since they don't have their own man pages.

Searching Files
The main difference is that $ls | grep ".txt" only looks at filenames in your current folder. In contrast, $find . -name "*.txt" actually dives deep, searching through all the subfolders recursively.

Because of that, $find$ is way more powerful. Use it when you need to search an entire project or find files based on things like their size or when they were last edited.

Piping to grep
Yep, you can do the exact same thing with your command history. If you want to find a command you ran that used the word docker, you'd just type:

$history | grep "docker"

It's a great way to find a command you can't quite remember.

Archiving
You'd send a .tar.gz file to another Linux developer because it saves important things like file permissions. A .zip file can mess those up, which might break the project on their end. It's the native format, so it just works.

As for security, the biggest risk with an unknown archive is a "path traversal" attack. That's a fancy name for a booby-trapped file that tries to overwrite an important system file. It's always a good idea to peek inside first with $tar -tvf archive.tar.gz before you extract it.
